                    I realise as I write this, how monstrously long it is. It exceeds the length of the actual home page. I find this hilarious. The home page is meant to be succinct. This is not. It takes too much effort to condense information down to its… disgustingly short format the front page requires. Oh well. It serves its purpose. Be brief, in both resume and digital portfolio, as that increases one's chances of getting a job, right?

                    This website was created for my Career Preparation Programme II (CCP2) module in Ngee Ann Polytechnic. The assignment was to create a digital portfolio. Nothing special, fancy, just put everything (works; academic, personal, r&eacute;sum&eacute;) in one digital place. This module was designed in line with Ngee Ann&apos;s industry-centric pedagogy &mdash; they require all graduates to be in touch with industry trends. They want everyone to optimise their employability by having a proper digital presence (r&eacute;sum&eacute;, skills and content required to keep it up to date by ourselves; digital portfolio, all works in one presentable place; LinkedIn profiles for professional networking), so they mandated us by making two modules about it, the second one being conducted in Year 2 with assignments creating said digital footprint.

                    I took CCP2 in August 2020. I have no clue how long this edition of CCP2 has existed, nor whether a new edition has been pushed out.

                <p class="article-body-space">
                    I took this as an excuse to buy a domain, because having a domain is cool for my email signature &mdash; something they assigned us to create as a task, but not as a graded assignment. Thus, I simply took advantage of the&hellip; mandatoriness of the situation and had fun.

                <p class="article-body-space">
                    Unfortunately, I had few documentations of my thoughts and my process. Thus, I can only write so much, as most of it is retroactively reflective, and most details are lost to time and memory.

                    I have been with NameCheap since my original purchase on 17 March 2019. It is set to expire on 17 March 2027. I considered Google Domains in 2022 since it was launched in Singapore in that year, but I decided against it due to the different price points. The entry point for Google domains is &quot;Transferring this domain to Google Domains will cost SGD20 plus tax.&quot;.
                </p>
                <p class="article-body-space">
                    The following is my transaction history for NameCheap &mdash;</p>
                <p>
                    17 March 2019 - 17 March 2021, $28.70 USD
                </p>
                <p>
                    17 March 2021 - 17 March 2022, $13.16 USD
                </p>
                <p>
                    17 March 2022 - 17 March 2027, $70.80 USD
                </p>
                <p class="article-body-space">
                    NameCheap is satisfactory because it completes its primary function &mdash; it provides me with a domain with the best price I can find. However, it transacts in USD, which is more a reflection of USD being a standard for transactions rather than a personal company choice. Nonetheless, I would rather transact with SGD, of which Google accepts. Also, privacy is an add on for NameCheap, which is understandable, but I&apos;d rather have it as a default and as part of the core product.</p>
                <p  class="article-body-space">
                    Regarding Google Domains, it is good from a personal standpoint because it does the primary function, and is more in line with my desires (currency transaction, privacy), but it&apos;s Google. So much for doing no evil.

                    What I hate about my website is that it&apos;s built on CSS which is mobile-first, but my design considerations are all desktop-first. I hate it. This website objectively looks better on desktop than on mobile, and it&apos;s infuriating. I just want it to look good on both.

                    Due to my limited familiarity with HTML and CSS, and the complete absence of knowledge regarding Javascript, this website&apos;s functionality is lacking. There is no search function, comment section, and article sorting (Sort articles by date, tags, whatever). This is fine as I don&apos;t intend on this being an actual blog, rather just a place where I can put my thoughts down in this format and send it to a few friends. However, I recognise that this may be a problem in the future.

                    Given that I am a student, I want to keep the costs of running this website to an absolute minimum. Technically, the domain purchase isn't strictly necessary, but I want ownership of it. Plus, barely anyone sees this website, so there is really no point in hiring an actual coder to build a fully functioning website for me.

                    I write this after the fact. I did not keep a real-time documentation or journal entries regarding this project. Thus, a few details and specifics have been lost along the way. I have no idea why there's such a huge time span between the domain registration (17 March 2019) and the first publish (2 June 2019). I wouldn't have been wasteful and procrastinating, right? Perhaps I was busy with time-sensitive assignments. Perhaps I used a different platform to publish code. But I reject the second hypothesis, because I was familiar with Github's functionality and suitability for this project.

                    This uncertainty is unsettling. There is little to no hope of recovering the details of what happened.
