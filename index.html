			When I was 10, I decided I want to change the world.
			<br>
			<br>
			When I was 14, I began to realise the world was big. Too big for one person to fix. I began finding people. People who could somehow change the world.
			<br>
			<br>
			When I was 17, I decided that my reasoning was flawed. The world was too big. The problems we face are just too much for any person or any team I could find.
			<br>
			<br>
			Over the years, I made many connections. People taught me that my world view was idealistic. Change is not easy. I decided that hope resides in the future generation.
			<br>
			<br>
			I’ve always felt that my calling was in changing lives. I’ve always had the desire to help people live the best lives they could. Somewhere along the way, I decided I’m not good enough to change the world directly. So I set my sights on indirect change.
			<br>
			<br>
			Progress comes at a price for individuals, societies and the environment. I’m scared we don’t have enough resources to save ourselves as a species.
			<br>
			<br>
			Being alive today is crazy. What are we supposed to think? There is too much happening for anyone to keep track of a worldview.
			<br>
			<br>
			I’m placing my bet on teaching. Nurturing people who could be better than me. It’s an absurdly small chance, but it’s possible.
