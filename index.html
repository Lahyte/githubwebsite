<h3>
<br>
My time spent in school has developed me immensely. From academic to non-academic skills, my teachers has played a defining role in shaping my moral compass and my skill set.
<br>
<br>
My background in mass communication allows me to better understand the different ways to communicate effectively with my target audience. This means I can use my skills to personalise tactics in order to better educate my future students
<br>
<br>
In A CNA article, Jason Tan commentates that educators impart academic knowledge, as well as moral guidance to students. I feel a desire to make a difference in this way - to guide students in their personal and public life.
<br>
<br>
With the support of other aspiring educators and a positive attitude, I am certain I will grow into an educator worthy of shaping the talents of our future.
